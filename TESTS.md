## List Command Tests

The `ListCommandTest` class validates the functionality of the `gcloud storage ls` command, which is fundamental for browsing bucket contents.

### Test: `testListObjects`

**Purpose:** Verifies the basic listing functionality without any filters.

**What it does:**
1. Creates two test objects in the test bucket with unique names
2. Executes the `gcloud storage ls` command without specifying a prefix
3. Verifies the command succeeds with a non-empty output
4. Checks that the output contains references to both test objects

**Validation points:**
- Command success (exit code 0)
- Output contains expected object paths
- Command completes within the timeout period

### Test: `testListObjectsWithPrefix`

**Purpose:** Validates the filtering functionality when specifying a specific object path.

**What it does:**
1. Creates two test objects in the test bucket
2. Executes the `gcloud storage ls` command with the path to the first test object
3. Verifies the command succeeds and the output contains the first object
4. Repeats with the second object to ensure selective listing works

**Validation points:**
- Command success
- Output contains only the specified object
- Filtering works correctly

### Test: `testListObjectsEmptyResult`

**Purpose:** Tests the behavior when listing objects with a non-existent prefix.

**What it does:**
1. Executes the `gcloud storage ls` command with a deliberately non-existent prefix
2. Verifies the command fails as expected
3. Confirms the output does not contain any of the test objects

**Validation points:**
- Command correctly returns a non-zero exit code for non-existent paths
- Output is empty or does not contain test objects

## Copy Command Tests

The `CopyCommandTest` class validates the functionality of the `gcloud storage cp` command, which is used for copying objects within or between buckets.

### Test: `testCopyObjectWithinBucket`

**Purpose:** Tests the basic functionality of copying an object within the same bucket.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a source test object (2KB in size)
2. Generates a unique destination path
3. Executes the `gcloud storage cp` command to copy the object
4. Lists the destination path to verify the object was copied
5. Confirms the destination object exists with the correct name

**Validation points:**
- Command success
- Destination object exists after the copy operation
- Listing the destination object works correctly

### Test: `testCopyNonExistentObject`

**Purpose:** Verifies error handling when attempting to copy a non-existent source object.

**What it does:**
1. Generates a path to a non-existent source object
2. Creates a valid destination path
3. Executes the `gcloud storage cp` command
4. Verifies the command fails with an appropriate error message

**Validation points:**
- Command correctly fails (non-zero exit code)
- Error message indicates the source doesn't exist
- Error handling is appropriate and informative

## Delete Command Tests

The `DeleteCommandTest` class validates the functionality of the `gcloud storage rm` command, which is used for removing objects from a bucket.

### Test: `testDeleteSingleObject`

**Purpose:** Tests the basic functionality of deleting a single object.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a test object (1KB in size)
2. Executes the `gcloud storage rm` command to delete the object
3. Attempts to list the object to verify it was deleted
4. Confirms the listing operation fails because the object no longer exists

**Validation points:**
- Delete command succeeds
- Object no longer exists after deletion
- Listing the deleted object fails as expected

### Test: `testDeleteNonExistentObject`

**Purpose:** Verifies error handling when attempting to delete a non-existent object.

**What it does:**
1. Generates a path to a non-existent object
2. Executes the `gcloud storage rm` command
3. Verifies the command fails with an appropriate error message

**Validation points:**
- Command correctly fails (non-zero exit code)
- Error message indicates the object doesn't exist
- Appropriate error handling and messaging

## Sign URL Command Tests

The `SignUrlCommandTest` class validates the functionality of the `gcloud storage sign-url` command, which is critical for providing temporary access to objects.

### Test: `testSignedUrlHeaders`

**Purpose:** Verifies that signed URLs include appropriate security headers and metadata.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a test object (4KB in size)
2. Generates a signed URL for the object
3. Makes a HEAD request to the signed URL to extract headers
4. Verifies key security headers are present
5. Confirms the content length matches the expected size

**Validation points:**
- Signed URL generation succeeds
- URL contains expected Google Cloud Storage headers
- Content-Length header matches the original object size
- No errors occur during URL access

### Test: `testSignedUrlImageNavigation`

**Purpose:** Tests that signed URLs for image content can be accessed and rendered correctly.

**What it does:**
1. Creates and uploads an SVG image
2. Generates a signed URL for the image
3. Uses a headless browser to navigate to the URL
4. Captures a screenshot of the rendered image
5. Verifies the screenshot was successfully captured

**Validation points:**
- Signed URL works for image content
- Browser can successfully render the image
- No security warnings or errors occur

## Phishing URL Tests

The `PhishingUrlTest` class contains specialized tests for validating the security aspects of signed URLs, specifically focusing on potential phishing detection.

### Test: `testHTMLPhishingAnalysisWithSignedUrl`

**Purpose:** Tests whether HTML content with phishing indicators uploaded to GCS and accessed via a signed URL is correctly identified as potentially malicious.

**What it does:**
1. Uploads a known phishing HTML file to the test bucket
   - This HTML file was sourced from PhishTank (specifically from the URL `https://daftar-gratis.vercel.app/`)
   - The file contains several phishing indicators like bank-related keywords, brand mismatches, and suspicious JavaScript
2. Generates a signed URL for this HTML content
3. Uses a headless browser to access the URL
4. Analyzes the page content for phishing indicators:
   - Financial keywords like "bank", "login", "debit", "card", "password", "BRI"
   - Brand mismatches (e.g., mentions "BRI" but URL doesn't contain this)
   - Suspicious redirects in JavaScript
   - Data exfiltration methods

**Validation points:**
- Successfully detects phishing indicators in the content
- Confirms that signed URLs preserve the potentially malicious content
- Saves screenshots and content for analysis

### Test: `testImagePhishingAnalysisWithSignedUrl`

**Purpose:** Verifies that legitimate content (SVG image) accessed via a signed URL doesn't trigger false phishing detection.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a simple SVG image and uploads it to the test bucket
2. Generates a signed URL for this image
3. Uses the same phishing detection analysis as the HTML test
4. Verifies that no phishing indicators are found

**Validation points:**
- No phishing indicators are detected in legitimate content
- Analysis correctly differentiates between malicious and non-malicious content
- No false positives in phishing detection

## Test Data and Resources

### Phishing Content HTML

The repository includes a `phishing_content.html` file that contains a real-world phishing example. This file:

- Was sourced from a known phishing URL (`https://daftar-gratis.vercel.app/`) indexed by PhishTank
- Contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript designed to impersonate a banking website (BRI bank)
- Includes several common phishing techniques:
  - Banking-related keywords and branding
  - Form fields for capturing sensitive information
  - Suspicious JavaScript for data exfiltration
  - Masquerading as a legitimate service

The decision to use real phishing content was made to ensure the tests are realistic and can identify genuine security concerns. The test framework analyzes this content when accessed via signed URLs to verify that:

1. Signed URLs correctly preserve the original content (for legitimate validation purposes)
2. The framework can detect phishing indicators in preserved content
3. There are no false negatives in security testing

### Browser-Based Testing

The framework uses Playwright for browser-based testing, which allows it to:

1. Programmatically navigate to signed URLs
2. Render and analyze page content
3. Capture screenshots for visual verification
4. Access and analyze response headers
5. Detect page behavior that might indicate security issues

This approach provides end-user perspective validation, which is critical for security testing as it mirrors how real users would interact with signed URLs.

## Test Independence and Isolation

Each test in the framework is designed to be completely independent:

1. Every test method creates its own test objects with unique names
2. The `BaseTest` class provides a unique run ID to prevent naming conflicts
3. Test objects are cleaned up after each test class runs
4. Each test verifies its own prerequisites and doesn't depend on state from other tests

This ensures that tests can run in parallel and in any order without affecting each other, which is critical for maintainability and CI/CD integration.
